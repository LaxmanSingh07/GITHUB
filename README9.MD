### GIT REBASE

`It is some how similar to merge but it is not merge.`
`Suppose i am rebasing the branch1 to the main branch` then it will take all the commits from the branch1 and put it on the top of the main branch. It will not create any new commit. But branch2 will also hold the commits history as the main branch.`after the rebase` the new commit id is also different from the old commit id.
