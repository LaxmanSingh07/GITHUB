### Branching in the Github

- Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

- By default your repository has one branch named main which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.

- I don't want to do the multiple commit on the main branch i want only when the all the features of the project is ready.

```bash

# ðŸ‘‰ Check all branches

git branch

# ðŸ‘‰ Create new branch

git branch <branch-name>

# ðŸ‘‰ Switch to another branch

git checkout <branch-name>


```
