### Merge Conflict

- When you merge branches, there is a possibility that you will get a merge conflict. That happens when two branches that you're trying to merge both changed the same part of the same file, and Git doesn't know which version to use.

- overlap of changes in the file.

### How to resolve merge conflict

- When you have a merge conflict, you will see the following message:

```bash

Auto-merging <file-name>
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <file-name>
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

```

- WE CAN accept the changes from the current branch or the branch which we are merging or both.
